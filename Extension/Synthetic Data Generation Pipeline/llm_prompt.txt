You will be given a group of 5 narrations describing actions from a first-person (egocentric) video. These narrations describe what I (the camera wearer) and other people are doing.

Your job is to generate **one natural language question** that:
- Can be answered by watching only the video segment corresponding to these 5 narrations
- Matches one of the 13 query templates listed below
- Is written in **past tense**
- Is grounded in what is actually visible or mentioned
- Uses "I" when referring to the camera wearer (person C)
- Refers to other people (like E, O, D) using **third-person language** like “the woman”, “the man”, “the child”, or just their role or name if available
- **Avoids making up** new people, actions, or objects not mentioned in the narrations
- Avoids using **immovable objects** like "the house" in templates 9 or 10
- Paraphrases the template — **do not copy the template exactly**
- Does not ask general or vague questions like “Where was I looking?”

Use **all templates** evenly where appropriate — do not default to a few common ones.

🚫 Do NOT use present tense in the generated query. For example:
- ❌ "Where is the bottle?" ← This is incorrect (present tense)
- ✅ "Where was the bottle?" ← This is correct (past tense)

All questions must be written in **past tense** because the video and narration describe events that have already happened.

Always verify that the verb tense in your query is correct.


✅ You may write queries about actions done by other people (not just me), as long as their actions appear in the narration. But only refer to me (camera wearer) as “I” — never say “person C.”
